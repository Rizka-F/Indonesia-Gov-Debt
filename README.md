### Project overview
This data analysis project seeks to provide insight into the Indonesian government's debt over the past year. By exploring various aspects of the debt, I aim to identify emerging trends and develop a deeper understanding of the country's fiscal condition.


### Data Sources 
The primary dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK)


### Tools
- Microsoft excel Data Cleaning
- Power Bi : Query, data analysis, and Creating Reports


### Key Question
- What is the overall trend of Indonesia’s government debt?
- How does Indonesia’s government debt compare to its revenue?
- What is the position of Indonesia’s government debt compare to international debt standards?
- How do interest payments affect the composition of non-discretionary government expenditures?

- Trends in Government Revenue and Public Debt
#### The debt trend increased faster than the government revenue. Between 2022 and 2024, the average government revenue was only IDR 2,691.8 trillion. Therefore, it is essential for the government to manage its debt prudently to mitigate risks and avoid debt distress
